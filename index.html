        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This App is an implementation of Othello (Reversi) game. It offers 3
          different modes of play (Single, Local Multiplayer, Online). This article will focus on the Single Player mode
          with the “AI” behind the computer play - Monte Carlo Tree Search.</p>

        <h3>About Reversi</h3>
        <p>Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board. It was invented in
          1883. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks, which are light on one side and dark on the
          other. For the specific game of Othello, the game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of
          the grid, two facing light-side-up, two dark-side-up, so that the same-colored disks are on a diagonal.
          Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of
          the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the
          current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The objective of the game is to have the
          majority of disks turned to display one's color when the last playable empty square is filled.</p>

        <h3>About Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</h3>
        <p>In computer science, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm for some kinds of
          decision processes, most notably those employed in software that plays board games. In that context MCTS is
          used to solve the game tree. The focus of MCTS is on the analysis of the most promising moves, expanding the
          search tree based on random sampling of the search space. The application of Monte Carlo tree search in games
          is based on many playouts, also called roll-outs. In each playout, the game is played out to the very end by
          selecting moves at random. The final game result of each playout is then used to weight the nodes in the game
          tree so that better nodes are more likely to be chosen in future playouts.
          The most basic way to use playouts is to apply the same number of playouts after each legal move of the
          current player, then choose the move which led to the most victories. The efficiency of this method—called
          Pure Monte Carlo Game Search—often increases with time as more playouts are assigned to the moves that have
          frequently resulted in the current player's victory according to previous playouts. </p>
        <p>The main difficulty in selecting child nodes is maintaining some balance between the exploitation of deep
          variants after moves with high average win rate and the exploration of moves with few simulations. The first
          formula for balancing exploitation and exploration in games, called UCT (Upper Confidence Bound 1 applied to
          trees), was introduced by Levente Kocsis and Csaba Szepesvári.</p>
        <p>Each round of Monte Carlo tree search consists of four steps:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Selection: </b>In this process, the MCTS algorithm traverses the current tree from the root node using
            a specific strategy. The strategy uses an evaluation function to optimally select nodes with the highest
            estimated value. The main difficulty in selecting child nodes is maintaining some balance between the
            exploitation of deep variants after moves with high average win rate and the exploration of moves with few
            simulations. The first formula for balancing exploitation and exploration in games, called UCT (Upper
            Confidence Bound 1 applied to trees), was introduced by Levente Kocsis and Csaba Szepesvári. MCTS uses the
            Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula applied to trees as the strategy in the selection process to traverse
            the tree. It balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off. During tree traversal, a node is selected
            based on some parameters that return the maximum value. The parameters are characterized by
            the formula that is typically used for this purpose is given below.

            <img src="img/UCT.png" style="width:30%">
            <div>where;</div>
            <div>Si = value of a node i</div>
            <div>xi = empirical mean of a node i</div>
            <div>C = a constant</div>
            <div>t = total number of simulations</div>
            <div>When traversing a tree during the selection process, the child node that returns the greatest value
              from the above equation will be one that will get selected. During traversal, once a child node is found
              which is also a leaf node, the MCTS jumps into the expansion step.</div>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <b>Expansion: </b>In this process, a new child node is added to the tree to that node which was optimally
            reached during the selection process.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <b>Simulation: </b>In this process, a simulation is performed by choosing moves or strategies until a result
            or predefined state is achieved.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <b>Backpropagation: </b>After determining the value of the newly added node, the remaining tree must be
            updated. So, the backpropagation process is performed, where it backpropagates from the new node to the root
            node.
            During the process, the number of simulation stored in each node is incremented. Also, if the new node’s
            simulation results in a win, then the number of wins is also incremented.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above steps can be visually understood by the diagram given below: </p>
        <img src="img/MCTS-steps.png" style="width:100%">
        <p>Essentially, MCTS uses Monte Carlo simulation to accumulate value estimates to guide towards highly rewarding
          trajectories in the search tree. In other words, MCTS pays more attention to nodes that are more promising, so
          it avoids having to brute force all possibilities which is impractical to do.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages of Monte Carlo Tree Search: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>MCTS is a simple algorithm to implement.</li>
          <li>Monte Carlo Tree Search is a heuristic algorithm. MCTS can operate effectively without any knowledge in
            the particular domain, apart from the rules and end conditions, and can find its own moves and learn from
            them by playing random playouts.</li>
          <li>The MCTS can be saved in any intermediate state and that state can be used in future use cases whenever
            required.</li>
          <li>MCTS supports asymmetric expansion of the search tree based on the circumstances in which it is operating.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages of Monte Carlo Tree Search: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>As the tree growth becomes rapid after a few iterations, it requires a huge amount of memory.</li>
          <li>There is a bit of a reliability issue with Monte Carlo Tree Search. In certain scenarios, there might be a
            single branch or path, that might lead to loss against the opposition when implemented for those turn-based
            games. This is mainly due to the vast amount of combinations and each of the nodes might not be visited
            enough number of times to understand its result or outcome in the long run.</li>
          <li>MCTS algorithm needs a huge number of iterations to be able to effectively decide the most efficient path.
            So, there is a bit of a speed issue there.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>App Specific Implimentation</h3>
        <p>This App is mostly written in JavaScript. No specific game domain knowledge has been applied in the algorithm
          in order to show the effective-ness in a pure Monte Carlo Tree Search. Allowed Time is the only variable in
          the MCTS process to specify the time allowed for search to run. In order to increase the effective-ness in
          every MCTS run, previous node/tree results has been processed and re-used. Web-worker is used in
          order to seperate threads on MCTS from the main thread to improve speed of calculation and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>Online Multiplayer is implimented with the help of RealTime Database provided by Firebase. No specific login
          detail is required during online multiplayer session</p>
